<p style="text-align: center;">2022–2023 NBA Player Analysis</p>
Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of NBA player performance during the 2022–2023 regular season. The goal is to explore player statistics to gain insight into how individual athletes and positions compare across the league.

Introduction
Basketball has evolved into one of the most globally popular sports, with fans and players emerging from every corner of the world—from North America to Asia. With its growing popularity and accessibility, more individuals are inspired to pursue the game and refine their skills. The modern NBA is arguably more competitive than ever, where nearly every player on a roster has the potential to develop into a star.

Social media and online platforms like YouTube and Instagram have democratized access to training, tips, and skill development. Aspiring players can now emulate their favorite NBA stars and incorporate elements of various playstyles into their game, creating a new wave of versatile and dynamic talent.

This project aims to investigate a growing narrative within basketball discourse: while the point guard position—traditionally held by shorter, playmaking athletes—appears to dominate the modern NBA, data may suggest it’s becoming a less central role than perceived. By diving into the statistics, we aim to validate or challenge this notion.
