## **Overview**

This repository comprises of an analysis of NBA players regular season perforamnce throughout the 2022-2023 NBA season. Throughout the repository we'll examine player's stats to get a better understanding on how certain players and positions match up against one another. 
### **Introduction**

The sport of basketball has become one of the most prominent sports throughout our world where its interest ranges from North America all the way to Asia. With this growing interest there are more individuals out there in the world eager to pick up and basketball and work on their skills. Right now, the NBA is as talented as itâ€™s ever been where nearly every player on a NBA roster could build themselves into a star. I strongly believe with the power of social media and the internet, the access to information on how anyone can develop their skills is easy to obtain. There are several YouTube videos and Instagram reels giving advice and training regiments on honing their craft. This gives players more freedom to truly develop their skills however they want to by emulating their favourite players and taking concepts for other players. 

The goal of this project is to showcase how the point guard position which usually consists of shorter players appears to have taken over the NBA but in reality, it's a diminishing position.
